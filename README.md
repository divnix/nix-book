# nix-book
The Nix Package Manager

Rendered book can be found at https://book.divnix.com/

This book is heavily inspired by the [rust-lang/book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and serves to provide new nix users a quick introduction to fundamental nix concepts.

It's recommended to use this resource as a precursor to [nix-pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/) which is much more in-depth on details, but a much longer read.

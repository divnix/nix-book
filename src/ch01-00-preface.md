# Preface

My journey to learn Nix was only made possible by my extreme desire to master it.
The path was anything but easy and predictable. And it is still a considerable
hurdle for many who try to learn Nix.

The goal of this book is to provide newcomers with a more approachable
document than the [nix-pills series](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills).
Although nix-pills is a very good resource
with many years of refinement, it is extensive and hard to follow without
some prior knowledge of Nix. This book hopes to
provide a more recent account of Nix with more of a focus on giving the user
intuition around what Nix is doing rather than a deep understanding like nix-pills.

The motivation for writing this is to provide a "Nix equivalent of the [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)":
one resource that can be read end-to-end in an afternoon that is able to equip the reader with the
knowledge necessary to thrive in the Nix ecosystem. The goal is not to replace any existing Nix
guides or documentation, but rather provide a good starting place for new users.

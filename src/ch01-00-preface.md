# Preface

My journey to learn nix was only possible by my extreme desire to master it.
The path was anything but easy and predictable. And it is still a considerable
hurdle for many trying to learn nix.

The goal of this book is to provide newcomers with a more approachable
document than the [nix-pills series](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills).
Although nix-pills is still a very good resource
with many years of refinement, it is extensive and hard to follow without
some prior knowledge of nix. This book hopes to 
provide a more recent account of nix with more of a focus on giving the user
intuition around what nix is doing rather than a deep understanding like nix-pills.

The goal is not to replace any existing nix guides or documentation, but rather
provide a good starting place for new users. Motivation for writing
this is to provide a "nix equilavent of the [rust-lang book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)".
Where there is one resource which can be read end-to-end in an afternoon and
able to equip the reader with the knowledge necessary
to thrive in the nix ecosystem.
